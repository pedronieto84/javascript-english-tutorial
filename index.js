console.log('hello world')

// const, let and variables

// const is a type of variable that you can't change

const name = 'Lie'
console.log('My name is', name)

// let is a type of variable that you can change

let name2 = 'Natalie'
name2 = 'Pedro'
console.log('Your name is', name2)

// var is like a let but it has some different behaviour over let in relation to the scope
