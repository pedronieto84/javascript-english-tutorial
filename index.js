// This is assigning a value to a variable
const name = 'Lie'

// EVALUATION evaluates if something is true or false

const isEqual = (  2 === 3  )

// == or ===
// == is more relaxed and does some deductions of what you are trying to type
const isEqual2 = ( 2 == '2')
console.log('isEqual with ==', isEqual2 )

// === is more strict in the evaluations and compares also de dataType
const isEqual3 = ( 2 === '2')
